# FCP Defra Identity example

This is an example service that demonstrates how to use the Defra Identity service to authenticate users within the Farming and Countryside programme (FCP).

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Defra Identity service credentials

## Running the application

The application is designed to run in containerised environments, using Docker Compose in development and Kubernetes in production.

### Start

Use Docker Compose to run service locally.

```
docker compose up --build
```

### Running tests

A convenience script is provided to run automated tests in a containerised
environment. This will rebuild images before running tests via docker-compose,
using a combination of `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.test.yaml`.
The command given to `docker-compose run` may be customised by passing
arguments to the test script.

Examples:

```
# Run all tests
scripts/test

# Run tests with file watch
scripts/test -w
```
